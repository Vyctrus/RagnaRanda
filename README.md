Simple support tool for Ragnarock (VR) map generation. IT IS NOT SEPARETE map editor, only some utility tool for Edda program https://pkbeam.github.io/Edda/getting-started

In Edda to craete map you need to press '1','2','3','4' in the rythm of song. As simple human being i was able to only focus to one thing - keeping up with rythm of song i was mapping, so i had no capacity to "design" interesting combinations on the go. So I thought about
making some tool to "randomize" combinations I was creating.

This tool outputs some random number or two (in case of two drums being hit at once) when user i pressing key 'Z' - you just need to listen music and tap Z in tempo/rythm.
Map needs to be reviewed after such creation, but I find it usefull especially for quick generation of maps with difficulties around 1-4.


todo:
-'X' button implementation; sometimes you want some parts to be more repeatable and You can even hear it - thats why combiantion 'Z' 'X' 'Z' 'X' 'Z' 'X' should somehow repeat same/similar patern without changing/updating sequence
-store DrumSequences in *.txt file to let user change it
